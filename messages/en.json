    "altImage3":"The Brückenwirt house after revitalization",
    "beginning":"The Brückenwirt in Heinfels near Sillian has been family-owned for over <b>150 years</b>. The history of the “Brückenwirt” goes back to 1868.",
    "beginning2":"Since 1969, the then “Oberthaler” inn has been called “Brückenwirt”, which refers to the neighboring wooden bridge (Punbrugge).",
    "beginning3":"Originally, in addition to the restaurant, this traditional house also had its own butcher's shop and a small farm. The inn at the entrance to the Villgratental was an important place to stop and stay overnight for carters and merchants traveling to Lienz and Italy.",
    "highWater":"In 1963 Gertrud (born Oberthaler) and Heribert Pichler took over the property.",
    "highWater2":"Now getting on in years, they renovated the old walls with a lot of love and zeal. However, shortly before completion, the old inn was severely affected by a flood disaster in 1966. Due to the heavy rains around August 17th, the Villgraterbach found a new stream bed and flowed through the basement of the building.",
    "highWater3":"After unsuccessful renovation measures on the old farm, today's Brückenwirt was built between 1967 and 1969. Gertrud and Heribert Pichler have created a tradition-conscious company with a lot of hard work and love. With the handover from the parent generation to the next generation, the bridge host further develops and adapts to the needs of the present.",
    "revitalisation":"In 2014 the Brückenwirt was completely renovated, revitalized and reopened in autumn 2014. The rooms have been converted into high-quality apartments. Each holiday apartment has access to at least one balcony with a clear view to the east towards Lienz, to the south to the Carnic Alps or to the west. Each apartment has its own personal touch. "
